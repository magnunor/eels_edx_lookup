eels_edx_lookup
===============
A program to view EELS edges ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_energy_loss_spectroscopy ) and EDX ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy ) lines for different elements.

Currently only works for the MeeGo/Harmattan Nokia N9. Also runs on linux desktops, if some MeeGo specific QML elements are commented out. 

Should not be too hard to port to Jolla's Sailfish. Should be possible to port it to Android as well, since both Python and QML is avaliable.

EELS and EDX data for the different elements from Hyperspy ( http://hyperspy.org/ )
